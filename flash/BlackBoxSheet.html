NAME: _________________________________________________<br /><br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Box is not necessarily a black box at all.  It is the idea that in science you often have to come up with creative and indirect methods to reveal properties of things we can not see or measure directly.  Rutherford used a version of this to discover what the structure of the atom was without ever seeing an individual atom in his now famous Alpha Scattering Experiment (where he shot alpha particles through gold foil).  Millikan used another version of this idea to find out what the charge was on a single electron in his Oil Drop Experiment.  In this lab you will do the same as these two scientists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run the <a href="BlackBox.html">Black Box</a> simulation. Fill in the boxes below with the shapes you believe are hidden by the black box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Mr. U had nothing do and was so bored that he decided to an experiment.  He took a giant box of paper clips, all of equal size, shape and mass.  He then took a handful of these paper clips, tossed them onto a balance, and weighed them.  He then threw them away, took another handful, and weighed them.  He repeated this 31 times and tabulated his results (shown at right).  Some handfuls were big, some small as you can see.  Your job is to find out what the mass of a single paper clip.  My suggestion is that you copy and paste the values onto an Excel spreadsheet and work with them (I used the Data Sort, Average functions, along with basic math functions).</p>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br />
<ol><li>What did you find to be the mass of a single paper clip?
</li><li>Explain your procedure or the calculations you did to arrive at this fully (you do NOT need to include your data).
</li><li>Explain why it is also possible for the mass to have been a fraction, say a half or a third of your answer.
</li><li>Explain why Mr. U had to make things so complicated and decided against simply weighing a single paper clip in the first place!
