<p>Try the following examples with the <a href = "VectorAddition.html">vector addition simulation</a>, and try to answer the questions:</p>

<ol><li>Position vector A in any position, and then adjust the position of vector B so that the resultant is 0.  Try several examples until you are ready to answer the question &#34;What is the relationship between vector A and vector B when their resultant is 0?&#34;
</li><li>Position vector A in any northwest position.  Then adjust vector B until the resultant points directly west.  Notice that there are many positions (theoretically, an infinite number of possible positions) that will accomplish this.  What is the mathematical relationship between vectors A and B that will accomplish this?
</li><li>Repeat step 2, but this time try to adjust B until the resultant points directly north.  How is this accomplished?  What is the relationship between vector A and vector B now?
</li><li>Is it possible to adjust B so that the resultant will point directly south?  How?
</li><li>Position vector A in any random position.  Now adjust vector B until the magnitude of vector A + the magnitude of vector B = the magnitude of the resultant.  Try other combinations.  When does the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors equal the magnitude of the resultant?
</li><li>Repeat step 5 except try to find a relationship between vectors A and B that will produce a resultant whose magnitude is the difference between the magnitudes of the two vectors.
